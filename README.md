I do not own most of the content used in this project like: 
* Images 

I do not earn money from this and the only purpose of it was to complete the corresponding course.

## History of the app
The point of the app was to help someone that needs to cook something but it´s tired of cooking the same thing all over again or if
the person it´s in a hurry and needs a cook recipe that can complete fast. It was inspired in my mom that always asked me 
"What should I cook?" and I never had an idea. It is functional but limited, so it´s not a heavy app.

## How to use
It´s pretty simple, you just select the ingredients you want to use and the time you can spend cooking. Then it will show you the options
you have, you can add them to your favorite list and it saves the list in a local database of MySQLite. In future updates ideas it´s planned to add filters, more ingredients, more dishes and enhance the UI. 

## Credit
You have all rights to use it as you wish, but I will be so grateful if you credit me for my hard work.
